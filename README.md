# Convolutional Wasserstein Distance Implementation

You need to download the train image dataset of the MNIST database on the website [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Then rename the byte file downloaded in `train_images` and place it in the same folder as the code.

To compile and run the code, just run:
```
make
./main
```
